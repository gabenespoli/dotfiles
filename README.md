My dotfiles. Always a work in progress.

Other than my personal vim config, these dotfiles mostly acheive two goals:

1. Harmonize keyboard shortcuts across macOS using karabiner. This includes aggressively enforcing emacs text-editing shortcuts system-wide.

2. Harmonize the colorscheme of various shell tools (n/vim, tmux, ranger, ipython, pudb, tig) based on having a base16 terminal colorscheme.
